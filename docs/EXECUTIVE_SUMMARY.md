# OneLink - Executive Summary

## Overview

OneLink is a unified link-in-bio platform that consolidates two essential use cases into a single, branded profile page. It enables professionals, creators, and businesses to share one link that intelligently routes visitors to the right action—whether booking a meeting or submitting files—eliminating the need for multiple links and complex bio management.

## The Problem

Professionals and creators struggle with link management:
- **Link clutter**: Multiple links scattered across social media bios, emails, and business cards
- **Poor user experience**: Visitors face decision paralysis when presented with multiple options
- **Fragmented tools**: Separate platforms for scheduling, file sharing, and link aggregation
- **No intent routing**: Links don't adapt to visitor intent or context

## The Solution

OneLink provides a single, intelligent profile page that combines:
- **Routes (OneMeet)**: Intent-first buttons that route visitors to schedulers (Calendly, Cal.com), documentation, or any destination
- **Drops (DropRequest)**: Public file inboxes where visitors can submit files without logging in, with optional metadata collection

## Key Value Propositions

1. **One Link, Multiple Actions**: Replace multiple links with a single, branded profile
2. **Intent-Based Routing**: Guide visitors to the right action based on their needs
3. **Zero-Friction File Sharing**: Accept files from anyone without requiring account creation
4. **Unified Infrastructure**: Shared authentication, billing, domains, and storage
5. **Clean, Professional UX**: Modern design that scales from free to enterprise

**Pro ($10/month)**: 5GB/file, 90-day retention, advanced fields, Google Analytics integration, priority support

## Target Market

- **Primary**: Freelancers, consultants, coaches, and creators who need a professional link-in-bio

- **Tertiary**: Enterprise users needing custom domains and advanced analytics

## Competitive Advantages

2. **Intent-First Design**: Routes visitors based on their goals, not just link aggregation
3. **No-Login File Sharing**: Simplest file intake experience in the market

## Market Opportunity

The link-in-bio market is growing rapidly, driven by:
- Social media platform limitations (single link in bio)
- Creator economy expansion
- Remote work and digital-first business models
- Need for professional online presence

## Next Steps

1. Complete MVP development (Drop UI integration)
